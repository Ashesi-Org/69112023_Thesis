GUIDELINES

Final Thesis Notebook is a jupyter notebook that contains all scripts used in the capstone project.

Models were first trained and tested with balanced and unbalanced data.

All further work was done using the balanced dataset and hence will be found in the balanaced dataset folder.

There is a folder for models trained without feature selection features, and each of the feature selection techniques.

The analytics folder contains the scripts used for preliminary data analysis and data visualisation for the thesis write-up.

The data workings folder contains some csv datasets and r workspaces used in this project. Contact author for full datasets.

Data in scripts are currently set to author's local directories. Change path to load data.
